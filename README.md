# Base iOS Project for Pure Data audio synthesis library
This is a basic project that allows a Pure Data patch to be embedded within an XCode project for Univeral iOS devices. This project is uses the excellent [libpd](https://github.com/libpd/pd-for-ios) and was modified during a [Music Hackspace](http://musichackspace.org/) workshop led by [Ron Herrema](http://ronherrema.net/). The modifications follow [this youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLn3ODBv0ka5jDXKS374IhS95GeXp4sTGt) and will allow you to embed a Pd patch within an iOS app and update parameters in real-time. 

This project was created and compiled in Xcode 7.0
